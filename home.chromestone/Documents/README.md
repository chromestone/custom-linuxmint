* fanctl.sh
  * Usage: ```sudo ./fanctl.sh ['read'|fan_speed]```
  * Note: running ```./fanctl.sh``` without arguments will set the fans to auto. This is for safety in case you left the fans too low. Then you can save keystrokes if you need to set the fans to auto quickly.
  * Note: hardcoded for fan1 only.
